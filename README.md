# car-number-plate-detection
Make sure you have the 'car_image.jpg' file or replace it with the path to your own image. This code loads the image, detects potential license plate regions, and then performs character recognition using Tesseract OCR.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and real-world license plate detection systems often require more advanced techniques, including machine learning models for improved accuracy and robustness. Additionally, you may need to fine-tune parameters and preprocess images based on your specific use case.
